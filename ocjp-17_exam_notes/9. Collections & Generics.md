# Collections and Generics:


#### Exam Points:
- You have a collection (say, an ArrayList) which is read by multiple reader threads and which is modified by a single writer thread. The collection allows multiple concurrent reads but does not tolerate concurrent read and write. Which of the following strategies will you use to obtain best performance?
````text
Encapsulate the collection into another class and use ReadWriteLock to manage read and write access.//Correction Answer

````
- You cannot embed a diamond operator within another generic class instantiation.
- Example:
````java
Map<String, List<String>> stateCitiesMap = new HashMap<String, List<>>();// - You cannot embed a diamond operator within another generic class instantiation. Thus, new HashMap<String, List<>> is invalid because of List<>
Map<String, List<String>> stateCitiesMap = new HashMap<>(); //This is the right way to use the diamond operator.
Map<String, List<String>> stateCitiesMap = new HashMap<String, List<String>>();//This is how you would do it without using the diamond operator.
