# Collections and Generics:


#### Exam Points:
- You have a collection (say, an ArrayList) which is read by multiple reader threads and which is modified by a single writer thread. The collection allows multiple concurrent reads but does not tolerate concurrent read and write. Which of the following strategies will you use to obtain best performance?
````text
Encapsulate the collection into another class and use ReadWriteLock to manage read and write access.//Correction Answer

````
- You cannot embed a diamond operator within another generic class instantiation.
- Example:
````java
Map<String, List<String>> stateCitiesMap = new HashMap<String, List<>>();// - You cannot embed a diamond operator within another generic class instantiation. Thus, new HashMap<String, List<>> is invalid because of List<>
Map<String, List<String>> stateCitiesMap = new HashMap<>(); //This is the right way to use the diamond operator.
Map<String, List<String>> stateCitiesMap = new HashMap<String, List<String>>();//This is how you would do it without using the diamond operator.
````

- What will the following code print when run?
````java
Deque<Integer> d = new ArrayDeque<>();
d.push(1);
d.push(2);
d.push(3);
System.out.println(d.pollFirst()); //3
System.out.println(d.poll());//2
System.out.println(d.pollLast());//1
````
- f you use push, objects will be added in the front and if you then use remove, items will be removed from the front. In this question, you push 1, 2, and 3, that means, the Deque now contains 3, 2, 1.  Now, pollFirst() will return 3, poll() will return 2, and pollLast() will return 1. Hence, it will print 3, 2, 1.
