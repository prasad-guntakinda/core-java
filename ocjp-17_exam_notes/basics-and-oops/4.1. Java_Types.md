<summary>1. Classes:</summary>



## Exam Points:

### abstract classes:

    - A class is uninstantiable if the class is declared abstract.

    - If a method has been declared as abstract, it cannot provide an implementation (i.e. it cannot have a method body ) and the class containing that method must be declared abstract).

    - If a method is not declared abstract, it must provide a method body (the class can be abstract but not necessarily so).

    - If any method in a class is declared abstract, then the whole class must be declared abstract.

    - An class can still be made abstract even if it has no abstract method.

<summary>2. Interfaces: </summary>

![interface_definition.png](interface_definition.png)

![interface_impl_class_syntax.png](interface_impl_class_syntax.png)

#### Inheriting Duplicate Abstract Methods:

````java
public interface Herbivore { public void eatPlants(); }
public interface Omnivore { public void eatPlants(); }

public class Bear implements Herbivore, Omnivore {
  public void eatPlants() {
    System.out.println("Eating plants");
  }
}
//Two interfaces are compatible. Below are incompatible due to different method declarations

public interface Herbivore { public void eatPlants(); }
public interface Omnivore { public int eatPlants(); }
public class Tiger implements Herbivore, Omnivore { // DOES NOT COMPILE
    
}

````

#### Interface Implicit Modifiers:

- An implicit modifier is a modifier that the compiler automatically inserts into the code.
  For example, an interface is always considered to be abstract, even if it is not marked so.
        
      - Interfaces are implicitly abstract.
 
      - Interface variables are implicitly public, static, and final.
 
      - Interface methods without a body are implicitly abstract.
 
      - Interface methods without the private modifier are implicitly public.


#### Declaring Concrete Interface Methods:

- Interface member types:

![interface_member_types.png](interface_member_types.png)

- interfaces now support private methods. They do not support package and protected access

#### Default Interface Method Definition Rules:


    1. A default method may be declared only within an interface.

    2. A default method must be marked with the default keyword and include a method body.

    3. A default method is implicitly public.

    4. A default method cannot be marked abstract, final, or static.

    5. A default method may be overridden by a class that implements the interface.

    6. If a class inherits two or more default methods with the same method signature, then the class must override the method.

#### Inheriting Duplicate default Methods:

````java
public interface Walk {
    public default int getSpeed() { return 5; }
}
public interface Run {
    public default int getSpeed() { return 10; }
}
public class Cat implements Walk, Run {} // DOES NOT COMPILE: 
//it is not clear whether the code should output 5 or 10.

//Solution:1 overriding by class
public class Cat implements Walk, Run {
  public int getSpeed() { return 1; }
}

//Solution:2 By using Interface name with super keyword

public class Cat implements Walk, Run {
  public int getSpeed() {
    return 1;
  }
  public int getWalkSpeed() {
    return Walk.super.getSpeed();
  } 
}
````

#### Static Interface Method Definition Rules:

    1. A static method must be marked with the static keyword and include a method body.

    2. A static method without an access modifier is implicitly public.

    3. A static method cannot be marked abstract or final.

    4. A static method is not inherited and cannot be accessed in a class implementing the interface without a reference to the interface name.


- Example for Rule-4:

````java
public interface Hop {
  static int getJumpHeight() {
    return 8;
  } 
}

public class Bunny implements Hop {
  public void printDetails() {
    System.out.println(getJumpHeight()); // DOES NOT COMPILE: Static methods are not inherited, so you have to use Interface name to access the static members
    System.out.println(Hop.getJumpHeight());//WORKS
  } 
}
````

#### Private Interface Method Definition Rules:

    1. A private interface method must be marked with the private modifier and include a method body.

    2. A private static interface method may be called by any method within the interface definition.

    3. A private interface method may only be called by default and other private non-static methods within the interface definition.

- a private interface method is only accessible to non-static methods defined within the interface. A private static interface method, on the other hand, can be accessed by any method in the interface.
- For both types of private methods, a class inheriting the interface cannot directly invoke them.
- default and private non-static methods can access abstract methods declared in the interface. This is the primary reason we associate these methods with instance membership.

````java
public interface ZooRenovation {
    public String projectName();
    abstract String status();
    default void printStatus() {
        System.out.print("The " + projectName() + " project " + status());
    } 
}
````

![interface_member_access.png](interface_member_access.png)

- quick tips for the exam:

      - Treat abstract, default, and non-static private methods as belonging to an instance of the interface.
      - Treat static methods and variables as belonging to the interface class object.
      - All private interface method types are only accessible within the interface declaration.

<summary>3. Enums: </summary>

````java
enum Title
{
    MR("Mr."), MS1("Ms."),AB("A"), MS2("Ms.");
    private String title;
    private Title(String s){
    title = s;
    }  
}

public class TestClass{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var ts = new TreeSet<Title>();
        ts.add(Title.MS2);
        ts.add(Title.MR);
        ts.add(Title.MS1);
        for(Title t :  ts){
            System.out.println(t);
        }
    }
}
//Output: MR,MS1,AB,MS2 this is the order which they are defined.
````
#### Examp Points:

- Every enum implements Comparable and the natural order of enums is **the order in which they are defined**.
- An enum with many constructors, fields, and methods may start to resemble a full-featured class.
- 

#### Summary Exam Points:


      1. You need to know the following facts about enums:

      2. Enum constructor is always private. You cannot make it public or protected. If an enum type has no constructor declarations, then a private constructor that takes no parameters is automatically provided.

      3. An enum is implicitly final, which means you cannot extend it. For the same reason, it cannot be sealed.

      4. You cannot extend an enum from another enum or class because an enum implicitly extends java.lang.Enum. But an enum can implement interfaces.

      5. Since enum maintains exactly one instance of its constants, you cannot clone it. You cannot even override the clone method in an enum because java.lang.Enum makes it final.

      6. Compiler provides an enum with two public static methods automatically - values() and valueOf(String). The values() method returns an array of its constants and valueOf() method tries to match the String argument exactly (i.e. case sensitive) with an enum constant and returns that constant if successful otherwise it throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException.

      7. By default, an enum's toString() prints the enum name but you can override it to print anything you want.

      8. It implements java.io.Serializable.

      9. It implements java.lang.Comparable (thus, an enum can be added to sorted collections such as SortedSet, TreeSet, and TreeMap). The natural order of the enum values is the order in which they are defined i.e. in the order of their ordinal value.
      
      10. It has a method ordinal(), which returns the index (starting with 0) of that constant i.e. the position of that constant in its enum declaration.

      11. It has a method name(), which returns the name of this enum constant, exactly as declared in its enum declaration.


- EQ1:
- Unlike a regular java class, you cannot access a non-final static field from an enum's constructor.
```java
enum Pets
{
  DOG("D"), CAT("C"), FISH("F");
  static String prefix = "I am ";
  String name;
  Pets(String s) { name = prefix + s;} //DOES NOT COMPILE
  public String getData(){ return name; }
}
```

<summary>4. Nested Classes:</summary>

## 3. Nested Classes:
- A nested class is a class that is defined within another class.

        - Inner class: A non-static type defined at the member level of a class
        - Static nested class: A static type defined at the member level of a class
        - Local class: A class defined within a method body
        - Anonymous class: A special case of a local class that does not have a name
- the term nested class to refer to all nested types, including nested interfaces, enums, records, and annotations.
- You might even come across literature that refers to all of them as inner classes.

![nested_classes_syntax_rules.png](nested_classes_syntax_rules.png)

![nested_classes_access_rules.png](nested_classes_access_rules.png)



#### 1. Inner Classes

- An inner class, also called a member inner class, is a non-static type defined at the member level of a class (the same level as the methods, instance variables, and constructors).

- Since an inner class is not static, it has to be called using an instance of the outer class. That means you have to create two objects.
- Examples:

````java
public class Home {
    private String greeting = "Hi"; // Outer class instance variable

    protected class Room { // Inner class declaration
        public int repeat = 3;
        public void enter() {
            for (int i = 0; i < repeat; i++) greet(greeting);
        }
        private static void greet(String message) {
            System.out.println(message);
        }
    }

    public void enterRoom() { // Instance method in outer class
        var room = new Room(); // Create the inner class instance
        room.enter();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var home = new Home(); // Create the outer class instance
        home.enterRoom();
    } 
}
````

- How to create an instance of inner classes?
````java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    var home = new Home();
    Room room = home.new Room(); // Create the inner class instance
    room.enter();
    //or
    new Home().new Room().enter();
}
````
- **Note: Nested Classes Can Now Have static Members**
- Inner classes can have the same variable names as outer classes, making scope a little tricky.

````java
public class A {
    private int x = 10;
    class B {
        private int x = 20;
        class C {
            private int x = 30;
            public void allTheX() {
                System.out.println(x); // 30
                System.out.println(this.x); // 30
                System.out.println(B.this.x); // 20
                System.out.println(A.this.x); // 10
            } 
        } 
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new A();
        A.B b = a.new B();
        A.B.C c = b.new C();
        c.allTheX();
    }
}
````

- Inner Classes Require an Instance:

````java
public class Fox {
    private class Den {}
    public void goHome() {
        new Den();//allowed because called from instance method
    }
    public static void visitFriend() {
     new Den(); // DOES NOT COMPILE: from static method
    }
}
public class Squirrel {
    public void visitFox() {
        new Den(); // DOES NOT COMPILE: outside of class scope + Den class is private
    }
}
````

### 2. static Nested Class:

- A static nested class is a static type defined at the member level.
- Unlike an inner class, a static nested class can be instantiated without an instance of the enclosing class.
- The trade-off, though, is that it can’t access instance variables or methods declared in the outer class.
- Examples:

````java
public class Park {
    private String greet = "hello";
    static class Ride {
        private int price = 6;

        void greet(){
            //System.out.println(greet); // DOES NOT COMPILE: error: non-static variable greet cannot be referenced from a static context

            System.out.println(new Park().greet); //WORKS
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var ride = new Ride(); //directly created because of static nested class
        new Park.Ride().greet(); //WORKS
        System.out.println(ride.price);
        //new Park().new Ride(); //DOES NOT COMPILE:  qualified new of static class
    }
}
````

### 3. Local Class

- A local class is a nested class defined within a method, constructors, and initializers.
- Like local variables, a local class declaration does not exist until the method is invoked, and it goes out of scope when the method returns. 
- This means you can create instances only from within the method. Those instances can still be returned from the method. 
- This is just how local variables work.

- Examples:
````java
public class PrintNumbers {
    private int length = 5;
    public void calculate() {
        length=10; //WORKS
        final int width = 20;
        int x = 10;
        class Calculator {
            public void multiply() {
                System.out.print(length * width); //WORKS
                System.out.print(length * width*x);// DOES NOT COMPILE: error: local variables referenced from an inner class must be final or effectively final
            }
        }
        var calculator = new Calculator();
        calculator.multiply();
        x=20;
    }

    public static void addition(){

        class Calculator {
            public void add() {
                System.out.print(length+10); //DOES NOT COMPILE: non-static variable length cannot be referenced from a static context
            }
        }
        var cal = new Calculator();
        cal.add();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var printer = new PrintNumbers();
        printer.calculate(); // 100
        printer.addition();
    }
}
````

#### Why Can Local Classes Only Access final or Effectively Final Variables?
- Earlier, we mentioned that the compiler generates a separate .class file for each inner class. 
- A separate class has no way to refer to a local variable. 
- However, if the local variable is final or effectively final, Java can handle it by passing a copy of the value or reference variable to the constructor of the local class. 
- If it weren’t final or effectively final, these tricks wouldn’t work because the value could change after the copy was made.

### 4. Anonymous Class

- An anonymous class is a specialized form of a local class that does not have a name. 
- It is declared and instantiated all in one statement using the new keyword, a type name with parentheses, and a set of braces {}. 
- Anonymous classes must extend an existing class or implement an existing interface. 
- They are useful when you have a short implementation that will not be used anywhere else.
- Example: Abstract class

````java
public class ZooGiftShop {
    abstract class SaleTodayOnly {
        abstract int dollarsOff();
    }
    public int admission(int basePrice) {
        SaleTodayOnly sale = new SaleTodayOnly() {
            int dollarsOff() { return 3; }
        }; // Don't forget the semicolon!
        return basePrice -sale.dollarsOff();
    }
}
````

- Example: Interface:
````java
public class ZooGiftShop {
    interface SaleTodayOnly {
        int dollarsOff();
    }
    public int admission(int basePrice) {
        SaleTodayOnly sale = new SaleTodayOnly() {
            public int dollarsOff() { return 3; } //it should be marked as public because all interface methods are public access level
        }; // Don't forget the semicolon!
        return basePrice -sale.dollarsOff();
    }
}
````

- The anonymous class is the same whether you implement an interface or extend a class! Java figures out which one you want automatically.
- what if we want to both implement an interface and extend a class? You can’t do so with an anonymous class unless the class to extend is java.lang.Object.
- You can even define anonymous classes outside a method body.

````java
public class Gorilla {
    interface Climb {}
    Climb climbing = new Climb() {};
}
````

#### Exam Points:
- A static nested class can contain a non - static inner class.
- Methods in all nested classes can be declared static.
- A nested class may be sealed. Yes, it is allowed as long as the class fulfills other requirements of a sealed class.
- In general, there is no restriction on what a nested class may or may not extend.

<summary> 5. Records:</summary>

## 5. Records:

### Exam Points:
- A record declaration specifies a new record class, a restricted kind of class that defines a simple aggregate of values.
- A record declaration implicitly creates instance fields, which are private and final. 
- It also implicitly creates public accessor methods for these fields. 
- Together, the fields and the corresponding methods are called record "components".
- An accessor method is a method with the same name as the record field and an empty formal parameter list. 
- Such methods act as the getter methods for those fields.
- For Example:
````java
public record Student(
  int id, //record component
  String name //record component
) //record header
{ } //record body
````
- This is roughly equivalent to the following class:

````java
public final class Student extends Record
{
   private final int id; //component field
   private final String name; //component field
   public Student(int id, String name){  //canonical constructor
      this.id = id;
	  this.name = name;
   }
   
   public int id(){ return id; } //accessor
   public String name(){ return name; } //accessor
   
   //hashCode, equals, and toString methods are also provided by the compiler.
}
````

- Observe that the accessor methods do not follow the JavaBeans convention (where a getter method is prefixed with get). Further observe that instance fields are final and the class does not have any setters.

#### Basic Rules:
- You can define a top level record i.e. directly under a package, a nested member record class i.e. within a class/interface, or a local record i.e. within a method.
- A nested record class is implicitly static. That is, every member record class and local record class is static. It is permitted for the declaration of a member record class to redundantly specify the static modifier, but it is not permitted for the declaration of a local record class.
- A record class is implicitly final. It is permitted for the declaration of a record class to redundantly specify the final modifier.
- Records cannot be marked abstract, sealed, or non-sealed.
- The direct superclass type of a record class is Record. Thus, a record cannot have an extends clause and so it cannot extend any other class.
- The serialization mechanism treats instances of a record class differently than ordinary serializable or externalizable objects. In particular, a record object is deserialized using the canonical constructor.
- The body of a record declaration may contain constructor and member declarations as well as static initializers. But there are some restrictions as well:
    - It cannot contain an instance field declaration (static fields are allowed).
    - It cannot have an instance initializer (static initializers are allowed).
    - It cannot have abstract or native methods

#### Constructors and methods:

- If a canonical constructor is not provided by the programmer explicitly, the compiler will provide one automatically with the same access modifier as that of the record itself. It takes the same arguments as the record components and initializes all the components. This is called the canonical constructor.
- A programmer may provide the canonical constructor in regular form (just like the way you define a constructor for any regular class) or in a "compact form" like this:
````java
public record Student(int id, String name){
    public Student{ //no parameter list is specified here
	   if(id <0) throw new IllegalArgumentException();
	}
}
````
- After the last line of the compact constructor, all component fields of the record class are implicitly initialized to the values of the corresponding formal parameters specified in the call to new.
- If you write a non-canonical constructor in a record explicitly then, on the first line of such a constructor, you must provide a call to either the canonical constructor or another constructor. 
- For example:
````java
public record Student(int id, String name){
    public Student(){ //a non-canonical constructor
        this(10); //this line or a call to the canonical constructor is required 
    }
    public Student(int id){ //another non-canonical constructor
        this(id, ""); //this line is required 
    }
    public Student(int id, String name){ //regular form canonical constructor
        this.id = id; this.name=name;
    }
}
````
- An important difference between a record and a regular class with respect to constructors is that the compiler provides a canonical constructor for a record even when the programmer provides a non-canonical constructor and does not provide the canonical constructor.
- In a regular class, the compiler does not provide the default no-args constructor if the programmer provides any other constructor for the class.
- A canonical constructor cannot be generic.
- A canonical constructor cannot have a throws clause (not even a throws clause with unchecked exceptions is allowed) but a non-canonical constructor may have a throws clause.
- Accessor methods must not throw any exceptions.
- You may have other methods in a record as needed. In this respect, a record is like any other class.
- It is a compile-time error for a record declaration to declare a record component with the name clone, finalize, getClass, hashCode, notify, notifyAll, toString, or wait. Observe that all these are public or protected methods of Object class.
````java
record Student(int id, String name, String toString){ //DOES NOT COMPILE:  error: illegal record component name toString
	
}
````

<details>

<summary> 6. Sealed Classes</summary>

- A sealed class is a class that restricts which other classes may directly extend it.
- there is a way for a class not named in the sealed class declaration to extend it indirectly.
- we’re referring to subclasses that directly extend the sealed class.
- Is there any indirect way? Yes
- A sealed class declares a list of classes that can extend it, while the subclasses declare that they extend the sealed class

![sealed_class_syntax.png](sealed_class_syntax.png)

- Examples:

![sealed_class_wb_1.png](sealed_class_wb_1.png)

- Sealed classes are commonly declared with the abstract modifier, although this is certainly not required.
- 


#### Exam Points:

1. An inteface may have a nested sealed class,
2. The permits clause is optional for nested sealed classes/interface.
3. Even though the permits clause is option for a nested sealed classes/interface, existence of a direct subclass of that sealed class/interface is required.
