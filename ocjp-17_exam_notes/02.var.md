# Local Varibale Type Inference: var

- The formal name of this feature is **_local variable type inference_**.
- Compiler tries to infer the type if the context is not enough then it won't compile.

## Rules:
- **var can be used only for local variables.**
- We cannot use ``var`` for instance, static variables and method parameters
````java
class VarDemo2 {
	var x = 10; //DOES_NOT_COMPILE: var is not allowed here
	static var y =20;//DOES_NOT_COMPILE: var is not allowed here
	
	{ var z=10; } //Allowed
	
	void m1(var p1, var p2){ //DOES_NOT_COMPILE: var is not allowed here
		for(var i=0;i<5;i++){ //Allowed
			System.out.print(i);
		}
	}
}
````
- __var is still a specific type defined at compile time. It does not change type at runtime.__ 
- Once var is defined you cannot re-assign a different type value
````java
class VarDemo3 {


    { var x = 10;}

    static { var z=10; }

    void m2(int p1, String p2){
        var v1 = 30;
        var v2; //DOES_NOT_COMPILE:  cannot infer type for local variable v2
        v2 = 30;

        var v3 = 10; // integral value
        v3 = "10"; //DOES_NOT_COMPILE: incompatible types: String cannot be converted to int

        var v4 = 1.0;
        v4 = 1234456;

        var v5 = 10; //integral value
        v5 = 1.0; //DOES_NOT_COMPILE:  incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to int

        var v6 = 1/0; //compiles but exception at runtime
    }
}
````
- var can be used in ``for`` loop
````java
void printNums(int n){
    for(var i=1;i<=n;i++){
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
````
-'var' on variable without an initializer, the compiler looks only at the line with the declaration.
-  __var is not allowed in multi-variable declaration__
````java
public void doesThisCompile(boolean check) {
    var question; //DOES NOT COMPILE: cannot use 'var' on variable without an initializer
    question = 1;

  int a, var b = 3; // DOES NOT COMPILE
  var n = null; // DOES NOT COMPILE
  var x = 10, y=20; // DOES NOT COMPILE: var is not allowed in multiple variable declaration
  
}
````

- While a var cannot be initialized with a null value without a type, it can be reassigned a null value after it is declared, provided that the underlying data type is a reference type.

````java
void varNull(){
    var x = null; //DOES_NOT_COMPILE: cannot infer type for local variable x
    var y = "";
    y = null; //ALLOWED
}
````

- var is not a reserved word and allowed to be used as an identifier.
- It is considered a reserved type name. A reserved type name means it cannot be used to define a type, such as a class, interface, or enum.

````java
//this code does compile
package var;
public class Var {
  public void var() {
    var var = "var";
  }
  public void Var() {
    Var var = new Var();
  }
}
````

### Exam Points:
- is var used for correct scope of the variable? 
- var is allowed to use it only for local variables and inside the for
- Assigning null is not allowed, re-assign works
- Multi-Variable declaration is not allowed
- Does the compiler have enough Context to infer the type?
- var is not a reserved keyword, but only reserved for Type
