#### Deadlock Questions:
````java
public void getLocks(Object a, Object b)
{
 synchronized(a)
 {
  synchronized(b)
  {
    //do something
  }
 }
}

//and the following instantiations:


Object obj1 = new Object();
Object obj2 = new Object();

````
- obj1 and obj2 are accessible to two different threads and the threads are about to call the getLocks() method. Assume the first thread calls the method getLocks(obj1, obj2). Which of the following statements is/are correct?
- Ans: 
````text
A deadlock can be avoided if the second thread calls getLocks(obj1, obj2)
This option makes the second thread acquire the locks in the same order as the first thread. This is a standard technique to prevent a deadlock when multiple thread need to acquire multiple locks.
If the second thread is not be able to get the lock of obj1, it will certainly not try to acquire the lock for obj2. Therefore, obj2 will be available for thread 1 if thread 1 has already acquired the lock for obj 1. Thread 1 can then proceed to do its work with obj1 and ob2 and release the locks. This makes obj1 available for thread 2, which can then proceed to acquire the lock for obj2 as well.
