# Diamond <> Operator:

- The diamond operator (<>) is a shorthand notation that allows you to omit the generic type from the right side of a statement when
the type can be inferred. 
- It is called the diamond operator because <> looks like a diamond.
#### Examples:

````java

List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
Map<Long,List<Integer>> mapLists = new HashMap<Long,List<Integer>>();

List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
Map<Long,List<Integer>> mapOfLists = new HashMap<>();

````
- To the compiler, both these declarations are same
- To us, though, the latter is a lot shorter and easier to read.

- The diamond operator cannot be used as the type in a variable declaration. 
- It can be used only on the right side of an assignment operation.

Invalid Usages:
````java
List<> list = new ArrayList<Integer>(); // DOES NOT COMPILE

class InvalidUse {
    void use(List<> data) {} // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
````

## Diamond Operator with Var:

````java
var strings = new ArrayList<String>();
strings.add("a");
for (String s: strings) { }

````
- The type of var is ArrayList<String>. This means you can add a String or loop through the String objects. 
- 
#### What if we use the diamond operator with var?

````java
    var list = new ArrayList<>(); //DOES COMPILE

````

- The type of the var is ArrayList<Object>. 
- Since there isnâ€™t a type specified for the generic, Java has to assume the ultimate superclass.

````java
var list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("a");
for (String s: list) { } // DOES NOT COMPILE

````

- The type of var is ArrayList<Object>.
- Adding a String to the list is fine. You can add any subclass of Object. 
- However, in the loop, we need to use the Object type rather than String.
